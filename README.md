## 3. Data Microservice API

### 3.1 Overview

A simple, microservice built to serve fire danger ratings for Western Australia. This microservice is built
on-top of the asynchronous FastAPI framework.

The microservice collects current danger rating information from the BOM using a web purpose
built web scraper. If the web scraper fails the microservice will fetch the current information
through BOM's FTP server. The microservice runs a background task to continuously sync up the 
data to ensure that it is up-to-date. This microservice is also responsible for fetching current
weather information from an external API.

**üíæ Multiple Data Sources** - This microservice can collect data through the BOM FTP server as well as through
the BOM's website with a web scraper. The web scraper, although faster, is considerably more unreliable than
collecting data through the FTP server. The data sync process that runs in the background will attempt to use
the web scraper and if that fails it will fall back and use the FTP data source.

**üîÅ Background Data Syncing** - The data sources are queried once a minute to ensure the data currently stored
in the local DB instance is up-to-date. The data will only be updated if there are changes to the current fire
warnings stored in the table. In the unlikely event that a request hits the endpoint while a data sync is in progress.
The request will be delayed until the sync is completed.

**üåû Weather Forecast** - The current and upcoming weather forecast is included in the response payload to provide
the end user with more thorough information about fire conditions for a given area. *Not included when retrieving
by district name.

### 3.2 Installation & Dependencies

Navigate into microservice directory
```
cd ./MICROSERVICE
```
Create a new virtual environment
```
python venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment
```
./venv/Scripts/activate
```
Install pip packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the microservice
```
python ./main.py
```

**MacOS:** When runnning this project on MacOS you will need to have gdal ( Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) installed on your local machine before running. To install gdal using cask run the following.

```
brew install gdal
```

**Note:** If the default port 8000 is busy on your local machine you can modify, the port of the microservice in the `microservice.port` file.
